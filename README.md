## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS
- Display Flex (containers and items)
- Pseudo-elements and pseudo-class
- Media query

### What I learned

This homeworked allowed me to learn CSS more in-depth, in particular display flex, pseudo-elements, pseudo-class, and media query. I enjoyed learning pseudo-classes and make my website much more dynamic. Below is a sample of the pseudo-class that increased the size and highlighted my project display when hovered over.

```css
#project1:hover, #project2:hover, #project3:hover, #project4:hover {
  background-color: rgba(209, 209, 209, 0);
  width: 249px;
  height: 150px;
}
```

### Continued development

I had difficulty when first learning flex boxes. Most of the time I was learning by trial and error where I would try in putting different elements with display flex. I would like to implement this more in the future as it is helpful with organizing a website. I also found pseudo-class interesting as there are so many ways to make a website dynamic and interactive with only CSS. I would like to learn more about pseudo-elements also as it would be helpful for repeating objects. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me understand dispaly flex as it visually showed how different attributes affect the html element. 

- [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This website was again great in referencing several CSS tools with great demos and examples.
